### Steps for development:
1. Clone this repo 
2. Run `open index.html` in the terminal
3. Then run `sass --watch scss:css` (make sure you have sass installed globally -> `npm install -g sass`). This will automatically watch for changes in your scss file and compile it into CSS. http://sassbreak.com/watch-your-sass/
